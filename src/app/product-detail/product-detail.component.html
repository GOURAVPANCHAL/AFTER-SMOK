            <h1>HINGU</h1>
            <h3>What are the benefits of Hingu for Inflammation of the airways (bronchitis)?
            </h3>
            <p>MODERN SCIENCE VIEW<b>
                    Hingu might be beneficial in the management of bronchitis. It has antimicrobial and expectorant
                    properties.
                    Umbelliprenin in Hingu blocks smooth muscle receptors (muscarinic receptors) and helps relax the
                    tracheal
                    smooth muscles.
                    AYURVEDIC VIEW
                    Hingu is useful if you have cough related problems like bronchitis. In Ayurveda, this disease is
                    known
                    as
                    Kasroga and is caused by poor digestion. Poor diet and incomplete elimination of wastes lead to the
                    formation of Ama (toxic remains in the body due to improper digestion) in the form of mucus in the
                    lungs.
                    This leads to bronchitis.Taking Hingu helps to improve digestion and reduce Ama. This is due to its
                    Deepan
                    (appetizer) and Pachan (digestive) properties. It also reduces excess mucus accumulation because of
                    its
                    Ushna (hot) nature.</b>

            <h3> <b>What are the benefits of Hingu for Asthma?</b>
            </h3>
            <p><b>MODERN SCIENCE VIEW
                    Hingu might be beneficial in the management of asthma. It blocks the histamine receptors in the
                    trachea.
                    Umbelliprenin in Hingu blocks the smooth muscle receptors (muscarinic receptors). This helps to
                    relax
                    the
                    tracheal smooth muscles. Hingu also has expectorant property that helps to expel the mucus from the
                    respiratory tract.
                    AYURVEDIC VIEW
                    Hingu helps to reduce the symptoms of asthma. According to Ayurveda, the main doshas involved in
                    asthma
                    are
                    Vata and Kapha. The vitiated ‘Vata’ combines with deranged ‘Kapha dosha’ in the lungs causing
                    obstruction in
                    the respiratory passage. This results in difficulty in breatHingu. This condition is known as Swas
                    Roga
                    or
                    Asthma. Taking Hingu helps to calm Vata-Kapha and remove excess mucus from the lungs. This gives
                    relief
                    from
                    the symptoms of asthma.</b>
