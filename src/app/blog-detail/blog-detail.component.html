                    <p> 1. Nicotine: is a drug that is as addictive as cocaine and heroin. It occurs naturally in
                        tobacco
                        plants, although companies may add it to tobacco products. Within seconds of inhaling smoke
                        from a
                        cigarette the nicotine reaches your brain, stimulating The Nervous System, increasing heart
                        rate,
                        raising blood pressure and constructing small blood vessels under the skin.</p>

                        2. Tar: is a sticky black Residue that results from burning process. It contains hundreds of
                        chemicals
                        considered carcinogenic and toxic. The tar carries many toxic Chemicals to the lungs. It is
                        the main
                        Cause of throat and lung cancer. Tar leaves Stains on the smokerâ€™s teeth, fingers and lung
                        tissue.
                        Smokers having pack a day inhale about a quart of tar into their lungs in a year.

                        chemicals.</p>
                    <p> 4. Carbon monoxide: is a chemical contained in tobacco smoke which is produced as a result of
                        the
                        burning of tobacco. It reduces the ability of your red blood cells to deliver oxygen to tissues,
                        causing
                        the greatest potential damage to the heart, brain and skeletal muscles (tissues that have the

            <p> 6. Benzene: is classified as a group 1 carcinogen, meaning that there is no safe level of
                exposure.
                Benzene is a chemical that is used to make everything from pesticides to the detergent to
                petrol.</p>

            <p> 7. Hydrogen cyanide: is considered one of the most toxic agents found in tobacco smoke. This
                was the
                poison used in gas Chambers. In smaller doses like those found in cigarettes, it damages
                tiny hairs
                in
                the bronchial tubes which form the part of the natural cleaning mechanism. As a result,

        <h1 class="heading cardHeading">NICOTINE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS
        </h1>
        <div>
            <p>Millions of people know from personal experience thatÂ smokingÂ is a tough habit to kick. The reason is
                that nicotine is addictive. Even though nicotineâ€™s high isnâ€™t as dramatic asÂ cocaineÂ orÂ heroinâ€™s, itâ€™s
                equally as addictive as those illegalÂ drugs.
                AndÂ nicotine withdrawalÂ is very real. Itâ€™s why so many smokers try many times before they finally quit
                for good.
                Nicotine affects all areas of your body, from yourÂ heartÂ andÂ bloodÂ vessels to your hormones,Â metabolism,
                andÂ brain. When you donâ€™t have it anymore, you go through withdrawal. Youâ€™ll physically crave that
                nicotine hit and become irritable if you canâ€™t have it.
                Nicotine withdrawal usually lasts only a month or so, but you could be fighting the mental battle
                against cigarettes for a long time.


                Depending on how long youâ€™ve smoked and how many cigarettes you have a day, symptoms of nicotine
                withdrawal can last anywhere from several days to several weeks.
                Nicotine withdrawal involves physical, mental, and emotional symptoms. The first week, especially days 3
                through 5, is always the worst. Thatâ€™s when the nicotine has finally cleared out of your body and youâ€™ll
                start gettingÂ headaches, cravings, andÂ insomnia.
            </p>

            <h1>Physical Withdrawal Symptoms
            </h1>
            <p>Everybody is different, and symptoms of withdrawal depend on many things, like how long and how many
                packs a day youâ€™ve smoked. But for the most part, you can expect to have these common physical issues
                when you quit:
            </p>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Appetite.Â Within a day or so of your last cigarette, your appetite will shoot up for a while.
                        Cigarettes bind to receptors in the brain which augment the release of the
                        neurotransmittersÂ serotonin and dopamine from the brain. These twoÂ chemicals reduceÂ hunger, so
                        when theyâ€™re out of your system youâ€™ll want to eat more. A lot of people also find that they eat
                        to fill the time when they used to beÂ smoking. And unfortunately, you might crave more carbs and
                        sweets. The first 2 weeks are the worst -- most people gain about 5 to 10 pounds as they try
                        toÂ quit smoking.
                    </li>
                    <li>Cravings.Â Nicotine cravings are the symptom you will deal with the longest, and they could start
                        just 30 minutes after your last cigarette. Each craving will last only about 15 to 20 minutes,
                        but theyâ€™ll keep coming. Youâ€™ll need to do your best to avoid triggers (like drinkingÂ alcoholÂ or
                        being around people who smoke) and find ways to get yourself through each craving.</li>
                    <li>Cough.Â YourÂ respiratory systemÂ canâ€™t clean itself very well when nicotine is around.
                        As your body works it out, youâ€™ll probably have aÂ coughÂ that could last for a few weeks.</li>

                    <li>HeadachesÂ anddizziness.Â These are usually on the mild side, and theyâ€™re often the first
                        withdrawal symptom to show up and first to taper off.</li>

                    <li>Fatigue.Â Nicotine is a stimulant and perks you up, so youâ€™ll probably feelÂ tiredÂ without it. But
                        youâ€™ll also be restless and might haveÂ insomnia.</li>

                    <li>Constipation.Â For the first month,Â constipationÂ can be another unpleasant side effect.

                </h1>
                <p>Like physical symptoms, how much you are affected mentally and emotionally when you quit smoking will
                    be different for everybody. But assume you will deal with some or all of the following signs of
                    withdrawal:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Anxiety.Â Smoking relievesÂ stress, so your anxiety can skyrocket when you quit. It tends to pop
                        up around 3 days in and can last a couple of weeks.
                    </li>
                    <li>Depression.Â It can start the first day you quit but is generally gone within a month. But if you
                        have a history of anxiety and/orÂ depression, yours could last longer and you might need extra
                        help from your doctor to manage your symptoms.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Irritability.Â You might have a short fuse -- even find yourself angry -- from time to time as
                        you deal with the physical symptoms. Itâ€™s normal and should pass.
                    </li>
                    <li>Mental fog.Â Youâ€™ll probably have a hard time concentrating as the nicotine wears off and leaves
                        your body.
                    </li>

                <li>
                    <b>30 minutes to 4 hours:</b>Â The effects from the nicotine will wear off and youâ€™ll start to crave
                    another
                    cigarette.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>10 hours:</b>Â Youâ€™ll be very restless, physically craving a cigarette, and wondering how to fill
                    the
                    time. You may feel sad and hopeless.Â

                <li><b> 24 hours:</b>Â Irritability kicks in and your appetite increases.
